\section{Old status}

In the experiments, we allow $2^{10}$ test cases, only one variable is decomposed. Two experiments:

\subsection{No epsilon}
We continue decompose intervals even when their length is very small.

Result(see "1.1.xls" file): 50 problems in Zankl, round-off error is more likely to exist.

\subsection{SAT directed, epsilon=0.1}
After one interval is decomposed, we use IA to evaluate the two new intervals. We choose the interval which makes the TEST-UNSAT API have a longer SAT.

Result ("1.2.xls" file): 42 problems in Zankl.

\section{Current status}
We still set epsilon=0.1.

\subsection{Unbalanced decomposition using sensitivity}
Example: Suppose we have the constraint: 

$f = -x_{15}*x_8+x_{15}*x_2-x_{10}*x_{16}>0$. 

With $x_2 \in [9.9, 10], x_8 \in [0, 0.1], x_{10} \in [0, 0.1], x_{15} \in [0, 10], x_{16} \in [0, 10]$, the result of AF2 is: $0.25 \epsilon_2 - 0.25 \epsilon_8 - 0.25 \epsilon_{10} + 49.5\epsilon_{15} - 0.25\epsilon_{16} + 0.75\epsilon_{+-} + 49.5$
