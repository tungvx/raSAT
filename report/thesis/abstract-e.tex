The file \verb+jaist-e-master-abstract.sty+ is a \LaTeX style file
for JAIST-specific master thesis abstract.
Using the style file is recommended, but not limited.

If you do not use the style file, make sure that your abstract
includes the following:
\begin{list}{$\bullet$}{\leftmargin30pt\itemsep0pt\parsep0pt}
\item {\bf title}
\item {\bf author's name}
\item {\bf school, student number}
\item {\bf submitted date}
\item {\bf keywords} (2 through 5 is good)
\item {\bf copyright notice} 
	(Write ``Copyright \copyright\ \textit{date} by \textit{name}
    	 at the left bottom in the first page.)
\end{list}

If you do use the style file, which is in the following directory,
\begin{quote}
\texttt{/usr/local/share/jaist.texmf/tex/jaist/master/}
\end{quote}
make sure to define the following in the preamble:
\begin{verbatim}
     \title{title}
     \author{author's name}{student number}
     \school{your school}
     \date{submitted date}
     \keywords{keywords}
\end{verbatim}

Of course, you also need to describe \verb+\maketitle+ right after
\verb+\begin{document}+.
\end{document}
