\chapter*{\centering Acknowledgements}
\noindent I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor, Professor Mizuhito Ogawa for the continuous support of not only my thesis but also my life. He instructed me how to critically think about and evaluate research.\\\\
My sincere thanks also goes to Associate Professor Nao Hirokawa for his detailed and constructive comments and also for his important support through this work. I learned a lot from him how to write scientific documents. \\\\
I owe my loving thanks to my parents, my older brother, my older sister and my girl friend. Without their encouragement and understanding it would have been impossible for me to finish this work.
