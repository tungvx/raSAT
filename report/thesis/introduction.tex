\section{Polynomial constraint solving}
{\em Polynomial constraint solving} is a task of computing an assignment of variables to real/integer numbers 
that satisfies given polynomial inequalities/equations. If such an assignment exists, the constraint is said to be satisfiable (SAT) and the assignment is called SAT instance; otherwise we mention it as unsatisfiable (UNSAT). 
\begin{example} \label{examp:unsat-example}
$x^2 + y^2 < 1 \wedge xy > 1$ is an example of an UNSAT constraint. While the set of satisfiable points for the first inequality ($x^2 + y^2 < 1$) is the read circle in Figure \ref{fig:unsat-example}, the set for the second one is the green area. Because these two areas do not intersect, the conjunction of two equalities is UNSAT.
\end{example}

\begin{example} \label{examp:sat-example}
Figure~\ref{fig:sat-example} illustrates the satisfiability of the constraint: $x^2 + y^2 < 4 \wedge xy > 1$. Any point in the purple area is a SAT instance of the constraint, e.g. $(1.5, 1)$.

Solving polynomial constraints has many application in Software Verification, such as 
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Locating roundoff and overflow errors}, 
which is our motivation~\cite{Ngoc:2009:ORE:1685167.1685421,Ngoc:2010:CRE:1858996.1859056}
%DSP decorders in practice are defined by reference algorithms in C using floating point arithmetic. 
%In embedded systems, often it is replaced with fixed point arithmetic,

%For instance, consider DSP decoder like mpeg4. Usually, the decoder definition is given by a reference 
%algorithm in C, which uses floating point number. 
%In an embedded system, it is tempting to replace floating

\end{itemize}	

\section{Existing approaches}
Although solving polynomial constraints on real numbers is decidable~\cite{tarski}, current methodologies have their own pros and cos. They can be classified into the following categories: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Quantifier elimination by cylindrical algebraic decomposition (QE-CAD)} ~\cite{qecad} 
is a complete technique, and 
is implemented in Mathematica, Maple/SynRac, Reduce/Redlog, QEPCAD-B, and recently 
in
Z3 4.3 (which is referred as nlsat in~\cite{Jovanovic13}).
Although QE-CAD is precise and detects beyond SAT instances (e.g., SAT regions), 
scalability is still challenging, since it is DEXPTIME. 
%Since QE-CAD is DEXPTIME wrt the number of variables, 

\item \textbf{Virtual substitution (VS)}. ~
SMT-RAT toolbox \cite{smtrat}\cite{vssmt} combines 
VS, incremental DPLL, and %less lazy and 
eager theory propagation. 
Z3 (version 3.1), the winner of QF\_NRA in SMT competition 2011, 
combines VS, ICP, and linearization.

\item \textbf{Bit-blasting}. ~Bit-blasting in bounded bit width is often used in SMTs for QF\_NIA. 
UCLID~\cite{uclid} reduces the number of bits (i.e., narrowing bounds for SAT instances) 
as an under-approximation, and removes clauses as an over-approximation. 
They refine each other, which shares a similar sprit with {\bf raSAT} loop. 
MiniSmt~\cite{minismt}, the winner of QF\_NRA in SMT competition 2010, 
applies it for rational numbers with symbolic representations for prefixed algebraic numbers. 
MiniSmt can show SAT quickly with small degree polynomials, but due to the bounded bit encoding, 
it cannot conclude UNSAT.
Bit-blasting also suffers a lot when the degree of polynomials increases. 

\item \textbf{Linearization}. ~
CORD \cite{cord} uses another linearization, called 
CORDIC (COrdinate Rotation DIgital Computer) for real numbers. 
Both Barcelogic and CORD apply Yices for solving linear constraints.
Linearization also suffers a lot when the degree of polynomials increases. 

\item \textbf{Interval Constraint Propagation} 
which are used in SMT solver community, e.g., {\bf iSAT3}~\cite{isat}, 
{\bf dReal}~\cite{dRealCADE13}, and RSOLVER~\cite{rsolver}. 
ICP is based on over-approximation by interval arithmetics, and iteratively refines by
interval decompositions. 
It is practically often more efficient than algebraic computation 
with weaker theoretical completeness. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Proposed Approach and Contributions}
Our aim is an SMT solver for solving polynomial constraint. We first focus on strict inequalities because of the following reasons.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Satisfiable inequalities allow over-approximation. An over-approximation estimates the range of a polynomial $f$ as $O.range(f)$ that covers all the possible values of $f$, i.e. $range(f) \subseteq O.range(f)$. For an inequality $f>0$, if $O.range(f)$ stays in the positive side, it can be concluded as SAT. On the other hand, over-approximation cannot prove the satisfiability of SAT equations.
\item
Satisfiable inequalities allow under-approximation. An under-approximation computes the range of the polynomial $f$ as  $U.range(f)$ such that $range(f) \supseteq U.range(f)$. If $U.range(f)$ is on the positive side, $f > 0$ can be said to be SAT. Due to the continuity of $f$, finding such an under-approximation for solving $f > 0$ is more feasible than that for $f = 0$.
\begin{itemize}
\item If $f(\bar{x}) > 0$ has a real solution $\bar{x_0}$, there exist rational points near $\bar{x_0}$ which also satisfy the inequality. Solving inequalities over real numbers thus can be reduced to that over rational numbers.
\item The real solution of $f(\bar{x}) = 0$ cannot be approximated to any rational number.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
For UNSAT constraint (both inequalities and equations) can be solved by over-approximation. Suppose $O.range(f)$ is the result of an over-approximation for a polynomial $f$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $O.range(f)$ resides on the negative side, $f > 0$ is UNSAT.
\item If $O.range(f)$ stays on either negative or positive side, $f = 0$ is UNSAT.
\end{enumerate}

Our approach of "iterative approximation refinement" for solving polynomial constraint was proposed and implemented as an SMT solver named raSAT in \cite{VanKhanh201227}. This work improves the efficiency of the tool and extend it to handle equations. The summary of the proposed method in \cite{VanKhanh201227} is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Over-approximation is used for both disproving and proving polynomial inequalities. In addition, under-approximation is used for boosting SAT detection. When both of these method cannot conclude the satisfiability, the input formula is refined so that the result of approximation become more precise. 
\item Interval Arithmetic (IA) and Testing are instantiated as an over-approximation and an under-approximation respectively. While IA defines the computations over the intervals, e.g. $[1, 3] +_{IA} [3, 6] = [2, 9]$, Testing attempts to propose a number of assignments from variables to real numbers and check each assignment against the given constraint to find a SAT instance.
\item In refinement phase, intervals of variables are decomposed into smaller ones. For example, $x \in [0, 10]$ becomes $x \in [0, 4] \vee x \in [4, 10]$.
\item \citet{VanKhanh201227} also proposed a method for detecting satisfiability of equations using the Intermediate Value Theorem.
\end{enumerate}

The contributions of this work are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Although the method of using IA is robust for large degrees of polynomial, the number of boxes (products of intervals) grows exponentially with respect to the number of variables during refinement (interval decomposition). As a result, strategies for selecting variables to decomposed and boxes to explore play a crucial role in efficiency. We introduce the following strategies:
\begin{itemize}
\item A box with more possiblity to be SAT is selected to explore, which is estimated by 
several heuristic measures, called {\em SAT likelyhood}, 
and the number of unsolved atomic polynomial constraints.
\item A more influential variable is selected for multiple test cases and decomposition. 
This is estimated by {\em sensitivity} which is determined during the computation of IA.
\end{itemize}
\item Two schemes of incremental search are proposed for enhancing solving process: 
\begin{itemize} 
\item {\bf Incremental deepening}. 
raSAT follows the depth-first-search manner. In order to escape local optimums, it starts searching with a threshold that each interval will be decomposed no smaller than it. 
If neither SAT nor UNSAT is detected, a smaller threshold is taken and raSAT restarts. 
\item {\bf Incremental widening}. 
Starting with a small interval, if raSAT detects UNSAT, input intervals are enlarged
and raSAT restarts. For SAT constraint, small (finite) interval allows sensitivity to be computed because Affine Interval \cite{VanKhanh201227} requires finite range of variables. As a consequence, our above strategies will take effects on finding SAT instance. For the UNSAT case, combination of small intervals and incremental deepening helps raSAT quickly determines the threshold in which unsatisfiability may be proved by IA. 
\end{itemize} 
\begin{comment}
SAT-likelihood is introduced to measure the possibility of an inequality to be satisfiable. Sensitivity is proposed to estimate the influence of a variable to the value of a polynomial.
\end{comment}
\item SAT confirmation step by an error-bound guaranteed floating point package {\bf iRRAM}\footnote{% 
\tt http://irram.uni-trier.de}, to avoid soundess bugs caused by roundoff errors.
\item This work also implement the idea of using Intermediate Value Theorem to show the satisfiability of equations which was suggested in \cite{VanKhanh201227}.
\item We also extend raSAT to handle constraint over integer numbers. In testing phase, we only generate the integer values for variables. In addition, the threshold used for stopping decomposition is set to $1$.

\subsection{Inequalities}
Constraints with inequalities can be categorized into four cases:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{SAT with without touching}

$\exists x_1 \in (a_1,b_1) \cdots x_n \in (a_n,b_n) . \wedge_{i} f_i > 0$, 
\begin{itemize}
\item If $\exists x_1 \in (a_1,b_1) \cdots x_n \in (a_n,b_n) . \wedge_{i} f_i > 0$ is SAT, 
ICP eventually detects it. 
\item If $\exists x_1 \in [a_1,b_1] \cdots x_n \in [a_n,b_n] . \wedge_{i} f_i \geq 0$ is UNSAT, 
ICP eventually detects it
\end{itemize}
under the assumptions of {\em fair} decomposition and bounded intervals.

The boundary part is reduced to polynomial equality checking, 
which would be solved algebraic methods, like Groebner basis. 
Alternatively, by loosening equality to $\delta$-equality, 
$\delta$-completeness is obtained~\cite{dRealIJCAR12,dRealLICS12}. 

This paper presents an SMT solver {\bf raSAT} for polynomial inequality. 
It consists of a simple iterative approximation refinement, called {\bf raSAT} {\em loop}, 
which is an extension of the standard ICP with testing to accelerate SAT detection. 
Two approximation schemes consist of interval arithmetic (over-approximation) and 
testing (under-approximation), to accelerate SAT detection. 
If both fails, input intervals are refined by decomposition. 
%
Compared to typical ICPs, {\bf raSAT} 
\begin{itemize}
\item introduces testing (as an under-approximation) to accelerate SAT detection, 
\item applies various interval arithmetic, e.g., Affine intervals~\cite{Stolfi03,ngocase,tapas12}, 
which enables to analyze the effects of input values, and 
\item SAT confirmation step by an error-bound guaranteed floating point package {\bf iRRAM}\footnote{% 
\tt http://irram.uni-trier.de}, to avoid soundess bugs caused by roundoff errors. 
\end{itemize}
This design is more on SAT detection oriented, since from our preliminary experiences, 
if the target problems have several hundred variables, solvable cases in practice are 
either SAT or UNSAT with small UNSAT core. 
Thus, acceleration of SAT detection and finding UNSAT core will be keys for scalability. 

ICP is robust for larger degrees, but the number of boxes (products of intervals) to explore 
exponentially explodes when variables increase. 
Thus, design of strategies for selecting variables to decompose and boxes to explore is crucial 
for efficiency. Our strategy design is, 
\begin{itemize}
\item a box with more possiblity to be SAT is selected to explore, which is estimated by 
several heuristic measures, called {\em SAT likelyhood}, 
and the number of unsolved atomic polynomial constraints, and
\item a more influential variable is selected for multiple test cases and decomposition, 
which is estimated by {\em sensitivity}. 
\end{itemize} 
Note that {\em SAT likelyhood} and {\em sensitivity} are estimated during interval arithmetic. 
Especially, the latter can be applied only with Affine intervals. 
{\bf raSAT} also applies incremental search, which is often faster in practice. 
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Incremental widening}. 
Starting {\bf raSAT} loop with a smaller interval, and if it is UNSAT, enlarge the input intervals
and restart. 
\item {\bf Incremental deepening}. 
Starting with the bound that each interval will be decomposed no smaller than it. 
If neither SAT nor UNSAT is detected, take a smaller bound and restart. 
\end{itemize} 
Efficient UNSAT core and UNSAT confirmation % with error bound guaranteed floating point arithmetic 
are left for future work. 

They are compared on Zankl and Meti-Tarski benchmarks from 
QF\_NRA category of SMT-LIB\footnote{\tt http://www.smtlib.org/}. 
They are also evaluated by comparing 
{\bf Z3 4.3}\footnote{\tt http://z3.codeplex.com} and {\bf iSAT3}. 
Another advantage of {\bf raSAT} is the ease to handle mixed intergers, 
and experiments on AProVE benchmark from QF\_NIA category of SMT-LIB compares {\bf raSAT} with 
{\bf Z3 4.3}. 
Although {\bf Z3 4.3} performs the best, {\bf raSAT} shows comparable SAT detection on 
very large problems (e.g., with several hundred variables) with the combination of 
{\em SAT likelyhood} and {\em sensitivity}. 


\medskip 
{\bf raSAT} applies SAT confirmation to avoid soundness errors caused by roundoff/overflow errors. 
Another static analysis based approach is found in~\cite{SilvaTACAS12}.
