\section{UNSAT Core}
In \tiny IA\_UNSAT \normalsize rule, the negation of $\mathring\Pi$ is added into the interval constraint so that $\mathring\Pi$ will not be explore again later because it make the constraint unsatisfiable. As $\mathring\Pi$ always has the form $\mathring\Pi = \bigwedge\limits_{v_i \in V} v_i \in \langle l_i, h_i \rangle$

We have two ideas of UNSAT core here.
